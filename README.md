# YazowoNicowo
A Discord bot for enforcing mute rules in "Among Us". Lower the need to exit the game for everyone.

## Usage
A member with `MUTE_MEMBERS` permissions in a voice channel server-mutes themselves, which will trigger a reaction of server muting everyone in the voice channel with a 250ms delay, with a 7 second cooldown between being able to unmute everyone.

## Installation
    - `git clone https://github.com/zaida04/yazowonicowo.git`  
    - `npm i`  
    - supply ENV variables in a `.env` file in the root.  
    - `npm start`
